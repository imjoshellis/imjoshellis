## 📜️ Summary

I craft products that simplify the human experience.

Innovative tech excites me, especially when it's related to productivity, minimalism, mental health, tabletop games, or travel. Though I focus on the front end of web development using TypeScript/JavaScript frameworks like React, I'm experienced building both Express/NodeJS and Ruby on Rails on the back end.

My eight-year background in print, graphic, and web design gave me an understanding of how to engage with visuals, iterate on ideas, and create within specs. In 2019, I got my first real taste of building an app because I decided to build one for myself.

## 🎲️ My First App

I created my first real app, [BGQuickstart.com](https://bgquickstart.com), because I wanted a faster way to choose a start player when playing board games with friends. After teaching myself React, I realized I had fallen in love with the feeling of solving problems with code and immediately started planning my next app.

After some time, I decided to switch to a career in software engineering and joined Flatiron School's to accelerate the transition.

## 🎓️ Flatiron School

At Flatiron, I learned Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. It was exciting to learn how to work with the back end side of things. Databases, controllers, and routing were always confusing when I tried to learn it on my own. But after learning the basics at Flatiron, I've already gone on to learn my way around Express, GraphQL, and NodeJS to expand my backend repertoire.

I'm thrilled to continue expanding the skill-set I developed as a student at Flatiron School.
