## 📜️ Summary

From 2011 to 2020, I designed and built WordPress, Shopify, and SquareSpace websites and created marketing graphics for a wide variety of businesses and clients.

In 2019, I started looking to get more into "real" development and taught myself the basics of React to build a simple PWA ([BG Quickstart](https://bgquickstart.com)) to scratch my own itch.

I enjoyed the process more than I thought I would, so I immediately started planning more ideas while consuming as much free learning material as possible.

In early 2020, I decided to pursue development as a career, and I chose to enroll in Flatiron School's self-paced online program because I wanted to make sure I learned all the important concepts of Full Stack development in a structured way.

**I'll be graduating in a few weeks, and I'm actively searching for opportunities in tech.**

**If you're looking for a React developer who's a self-starter, eager to grow, and excited to learn, let's chat!**
